# Shlomi'f Home Assistant configuration

Iâ€™m using Lovelace mostly for my mobile devices and for Wallpanel tablet which some times used with 
HaDashboard instead.

The UI is partially isnspired by [Homekit Infused](https://github.com/jimz011/homekit-infused), 
implemented by me using mostly Custom Button Card and Delluttering Card for the templates.

## Current Configuration

Recently I switched from a raspberry pi 4B to an Intel NUC. I noticed that the Pi for my house was no longer powerful enough to run all processes. That is why I invested in an Intel NUC, which is now smoothly running. I also switched from hassbian to [Home Assistant - Supervised][hassio] in docker.

## My HA Server

Below my server setup on which I run Home Assistant:

- [Intel Gigabyte GB-BLCE-4105C][intel-Gigabyte] - Inside it 4GB Ram, 500GB SSD and running [Ubuntu Server LTS][ubuntu-server].
- Using the [Hass.io installation][hassio-install].
- [Sonoff Zigbee Bridge](<https://sonoff.tech/product/smart-home-security/zbbridge/>) - Zigbee Bridge With Tasmota

### In House   
:house_with_garden:

Curious about what kind of hardware I have in my Home Assistant system? I have a :pencil: list: [Check it out](<https://github.com/shlomifgm/HomeAssistant/blob/master/extras/github_resources/hardware.md>) (Last update: 30 October 2021).

## Grafana energy consumption dashboard

I have built my own dashboard in grafana for my energy consumption, which I can call through an iframe panel in Home Assistant. If you want to know more about this, [take a look here](<https://github.com/shlomifgm/HomeAssistant/blob/master/extras/consumption/README.md>).

## Back-ups
:floppy_disk:

Every day at 2:00 am an [automation makes a snapshot][backup-github] of my installation. In the past it happened that the sd card of my Pi became corrupt and I lost everything. That's why this backup is also made locally on my NAS automatically and this is fully automated. (Inspired by: [@adonno][adonno-github])

Nothing is better than being able to control your own smart home from your phone or tablet.
